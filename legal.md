# Intellectual Property & Licensing Notice

## 1. Scope of Disclosure
[span_1](start_span)This repository contains research and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code related to the **Simoes-CTT-Attractor** and the **α-invariant (0.0302)**[span_1](end_span). This code is provided solely for the purpose of vulnerability verification and security research under coordinated disclosure guidelines (e.g., MSRC).

## 2. Proprietary Algorithms
The following components are the exclusive Intellectual Property (IP) of Americo Simoes and CTT Research Laboratories:
* **[span_2](start_span)The SJI Protocol**: The proprietary masking and regularity enforcement algorithm[span_2](end_span).
* **[span_3](start_span)CTT Resonance AI Algorithms**: All logic pertaining to temporal resonance processing and $4.0 \times 10^{13}$ quantum advantage on classical hardware[span_3](end_span).
* **[span_4](start_span)[span_5](start_span)Temporal Refractive Index Models**: The first-principles derivation of framework-dependent constants ($\pi_{temporal}$, $c_{temporal}$, $G_{temporal}$)[span_4](end_span)[span_5](end_span).

## 3. Usage Restrictions
* **Verification**: Permission is granted to clone and execute this PoC for the express purpose of verifying the security vulnerabilities reported (e.g., VULN-173103).
* **Commercial Use**: Use of the underlying CTT mathematics, SJI protocols, or temporal integration frameworks for commercial product development, AI training, or production systems is strictly prohibited without a formal licensing agreement.
* **Derivative Works**: Any modification or adaptation of the CTT-specific logic for use in non-security contexts remains the property of the author.

## 4. Contact for Licensing
For inquiries regarding commercial licensing for AI integration, hardware-level SJI implementation, or full tech-rights acquisition, please contact the author via the official CTT Research Laboratories channels.
