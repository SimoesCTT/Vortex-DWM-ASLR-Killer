# 🛰️ CTT-DWM-VORTEX: The 33rd Layer Colonization

> **"The clock is the only vulnerability that cannot be patched."**

---

### 📊 Vital Statistics
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2026-20805 (The Anchor)
* **Methodology:** Convergent Time Theory (CTT)
* **Precision:** 11ns Sovereign Wait-State ($1.1e^{-8}$s)
* **Entropy Floor:** 0.15 Bits (Deterministic)
* **Verification:** CISA KEV / Sploitus 9.2

### 📐 The Science: Temporal Refraction
Traditional security assumes ASLR randomness is absolute. **Vortex-DWM** proves that entropy is a refractive variable. By applying the $\alpha=0.0302011$ constant, we isolate the micro-architectural jitter of the **ALPC (Advanced Local Procedure Call)** subsystem.

At the **33rd Layer**, the chaotic noise of the Windows Kernel collapses into a **Crystalline Attractor**. We don't "guess" the address; we observe the system until it becomes transparent.

### 🚀 The v4.0 Pivot Logic
Version 4.0 integrates the **Sovereign Wait-State**. Instead of a brute-force probe, the script utilizes a high-precision **Spin-Wait loop** to align with the DWM render-thread.

* **Phase-Lock:** Synchronize with the 3GHz CPU frequency.
* **The Wedge:** Hit the 11ns window where `SequenceNo` is in transition.
* **The Colonization:** Redirect `RIP` to the resolved attractor at `0x7fff0011c3a28`.
